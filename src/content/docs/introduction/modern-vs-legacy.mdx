<Aside type="tip">
  In this article we will compare the two main versions of TazUO: Legacy(.net472), and the modern version built on .NET 10.
</Aside>

### TazUO Net10 (Modern)

The Net10 version represents the **current evolution** of TazUO, built on **.NET 10**, and is where active development is focused:

- **Modern architecture**: Built on .NET 10 for improved performance and optimizations.
- **Integrated assistant**: In-built assistant with features like auto-loot, auto-target, and more.
- **Active development**: Receives all new features and continuous improvements.
- **Better performance**: Benefits from .NET 10’s improved JIT compilation and memory management.
- **Enhanced cross-platform support**: Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS with automated builds.

### TazUO Legacy (.NET 4.7.2)

- **Legacy architecture**: Built on .NET Framework 4.7.2, limiting performance and optimization.
- **Integrated assistant**: Lacks many assistant features.
- **Stagnant development**: Only receives critical bug fixes or user-contributed pull requests.
- **Limited cross-platform support**: Primarily designed for Windows but runs on Linux and MacOS with mono.

### System Compatibility 💻

- **Legacy**: Compatible with older Windows systems, requires .NET Framework 4.7.2.
- **Net10**: Requires .NET 10 runtime but offers superior native cross-platform support.

### Which Version Should You Choose?

<Aside type="note">
  For **new users**, we recommend **TazUO Net10** for the following reasons:
</Aside>

1. **Active development**: Receives all new features and improvements.
2. **Better performance**: Leverages modern .NET 10 optimizations.
3. **Improved stability**: More frequent bug fixes.

**Consider Legacy only if**:

- You absolutely need specific plugin support.
- You are using an older system that cannot run .NET 10.
- Your server requires features available only via legacy plugins.
