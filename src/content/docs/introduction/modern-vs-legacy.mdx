  In this article we will compare the two main versions of TazUO: the legacy
  version built on .NET Framework 4.7.2, and the modern version built on .NET 9
  (Net9). We will discuss their differences, performance considerations, and
  provide recommendations for new users.

### âš¡ TazUO Net9 (Modern) âš¡

The Net9 version represents the **current evolution** of TazUO, built on **.NET 9**, and is where active development is focused:

- **Modern architecture**: Built on .NET 9 for improved performance and optimizations.
- **Integrated assistant**: In-built assistant with features like auto-loot, auto-target, and more.
- **Active development**: Receives all new features and continuous improvements.
- **Better performance**: Benefits from .NET 9â€™s improved JIT compilation and memory management.
- **Enhanced cross-platform support**: Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS with automated builds.

### TazUO Legacy (.NET 4.7.2)

- **Legacy architecture**: Built on .NET Framework 4.7.2, limiting performance and optimization.
- **No integrated assistant**: Lacks modern automation features.
- **Stagnant development**: Only receives critical bug fixes or user-contributed pull requests.
- **Reduced performance**: Does not benefit from modern .NET optimizations.
- **Limited cross-platform support**: Primarily designed for Windows with no official support for other OS.

### System Compatibility ðŸ’»

- **Legacy**: Compatible with older Windows systems, requires .NET Framework 4.7.2.
- **Net9**: Requires .NET 9 runtime but offers superior native cross-platform support.

### Which Version Should You Choose?

<Aside type="note">
  For **new users**, we recommend **TazUO Net9** for the following reasons:
</Aside>

1. **Active development**: Receives all new features and improvements.
2. **Better performance**: Leverages modern .NET 9 optimizations.
3. **Improved stability**: More frequent bug fixes.
4. **Future-proof**: Net9 is the direction TazUO is heading.

**Consider Legacy only if**:

- You absolutely need specific plugin support.
- You are using an older system that cannot run .NET 9.
- Your server requires features available only via legacy plugins.
