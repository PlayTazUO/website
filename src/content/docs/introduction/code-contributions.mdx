# TazUO Code Contribution Guide

Welcome to TazUO! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our custom Ultima Online client. TazUO is a C# FNA-based game that utilizes SDL2, originally forked from ClassicUO but now maintained as an independent project focused on quality-of-life improvements for players.

## üå≥ Branch Structure & Targeting

**IMPORTANT**: Please read this section carefully to ensure your contributions go to the right place.

### Target Branches

- **`legacy`** - Target this branch for .NET Framework 4.7.2 code contributions
- **`dev`** - Target this branch for .NET 9 code contributions (actively maintained)
- **`main`** - **DO NOT TARGET** - This is the stable release branch

### Development Focus

- **Primary Development**: Most active development happens on the `.NET 9` version (`dev` branch)
- **Legacy Version**: We also maintain a `.NET 472` version (`legacy` branch) for plugin compatibility

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .Net installed.
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of C#, FNA framework, and SDL2

### Repository Setup

1. Fork the repository from [https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO](https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO)
2. Due to using an older FNA version, you need to run this:
   ```bash
   git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
   ```
3. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TazUO.git
   cd TazUO
   ```
4. Set up the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/PlayTazUO/TazUO.git
   ```

### Choosing Your Target Branch

**Before starting any work**, decide which version you want to contribute to:

- **Contributing to .NET 4.7.2 (legacy)**:
  ```bash
  git checkout legacy
  git pull upstream legacy
  git checkout -b your-feature-name
  ```

- **Contributing to .NET 9 (dev)**:
  ```bash
  git checkout dev
  git pull upstream dev
  git checkout -b your-feature-name
  ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Follow C# naming conventions and coding standards
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase style
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Test your changes before submitting a PR

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your changes work in various scenarios
2. **Check compatibility** - Test with different UO server configurations if applicable
3. **Update documentation** - Add or update relevant documentation
4. **Follow branch targeting** - Ensure you're targeting the correct branch (`legacy` or `dev`)

### Submitting Your PR

1. Push your feature branch to your fork
2. Create a Pull Request against the appropriate upstream branch:
   - **For .NET 4.7.2 features**: Target `legacy` branch
   - **For .NET 9 features**: Target `dev` branch
3. **Never target `main`** - This will be rejected
